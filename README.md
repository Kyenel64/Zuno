# Zuno
### A 2D, Lua-based game engine. <br>
### Lightweight, code-only, live-reloading

(Zuno is still in development. You can't create a game with Zuno yet. Sorry!)

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/Kyenel64/Zuno/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kyenel64/Zuno/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

What is Zuno?
---
### Zuno is a game engine.
Zuno isn't a framework, nor a library. It is a game engine that handles all the heavy lifting, so you as a game developer can focus on creating your game.

### Zuno is simple.
Zuno is designed simplicity-first. With Lua scripting and straightforward project configs, creating your game with Zuno is super easy.

### Zuno is familiar
Zuno's API is designed similar to Unity's API so if you've worked previously with Unity, transitioning to Zuno is easy.

### Zuno is easy to edit
Zuno's live reloading feature allows you to easily edit your game code and see it update live on screen.

Documentation

Zuno's documentation is coming soon!

Getting Started
---
### Building Zuno
Install cmake if you haven't already. <br>
Clone the repository and run: <br>
```
$ cmake -B build -S .
$ cmake --build build
```
This will build the Zuno executable in `build/`

### Running Zuno
Go to your build folder. <br>
Run Zuno with `./Zuno /pathToMain.lua` <br>
Zuno requires an entrypoint lua file as the first argument. <br>
Zuno comes with a sample.lua in the root file. In your build folder, run `./Zuno ../sample.lua`

Example
---
Here is a sample Zuno lua file. It can also be found in the root directory of the project as `sample.lua`, so you can run it.
```lua
function zuno.load()
    print("Zuno game loaded!")
end

function zuno.update(dt)
end

function zuno.draw()
end

function zuno.key_pressed(key)
    print("Key pressed: ", key)
end

function zuno.on_quit()
    print("Zuno game quit!")
end

```
